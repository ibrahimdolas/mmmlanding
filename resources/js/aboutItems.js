			en: `
			The “Math Magic in Motion (3M)” project is an innovative initiative that aims to make mathematics suitable for the
			world of young children. At an early age, mathematics is often perceived as abstract and challenging. The 3M project
			concretizes these abstract concepts with stories, animations, games, and digital activities that children can easily
			understand. In this way, mathematics is not merely about numbers and operations but becomes an adventure full of play,
			discovery, and exploration for children.
			`
		},
		{
			en: `
			The main focus is to strengthen the basic cognitive skills of children aged 3–6. Skills such as counting, sequencing,
			 comparing, measuring, and problem-solving—when acquired at this stage—lay a strong foundation for both school life
			 and future learning journeys. Moreover, the project not only teaches mathematics but also supports children’s ability
			 to think critically, establish cause–effect relationships, and develop creative solutions.
			`
		},
		{
			en: `
			What distinguishes 3M is that it places cultural diversity at the center of the learning process. The modules and
			animations in the project blend stories from different cultures with mathematics education. For example, sequencing
			skills might be explored in a Chinese tale, measurement concepts through a story from Anatolia, or geometric shapes
			inspired by Egyptian civilization. Thus, while learning mathematics, children also get to know different cultures,
			develop empathy, and learn to see diversity as a richness.
			`
		},

			en: `
			The 3M project aims to create a positive perception of mathematics at an early age, increase children’s motivation
			to learn, and provide teachers with digital, cultural, and engaging tools that make their work easier.

				The Math Magic in Motion (3M) project is an innovative initiative aiming to transform mathematics education in

				At the heart of the project lies inclusivity and cultural diversity. The mathematical modules promote not only
				counting but also empathy, cooperation, and critical thinking through stories from different cultures. Thus, early
				childhood education supports not only cognitive development but also social, cultural, and emotional growth.

				Led by Adıyaman University, the project is implemented in partnership with educational institutions from Turkey,
